# Introduction

# Figure 6B (also Fig S15)

First visualization (only 16, there is a duplcate metabolite in plot in SAP).

```{r Aim42analysis, echo=F,fig.height=12,fig.width=12}



#--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
# Get the week 0 values
#--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---


wk0_total_IgG<-Fig6.data$Figure4_total_wk0 %>% 
  filter(str_detect(name,"IgG",negate=T)) 

#--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
# Get the week 14 glycal gp120
#--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
wk14_glycal_gp120<-Fig6.data$Figure4_glycan %>% 
  filter(str_detect(name,"IgG",negate=T)) 

#--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
# Set up basis of analyses
#--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

Analysis<-wk14_glycal_gp120%>% 
  mutate(name=ifelse(name=="G1FB[6]/G1F[3]","G1F[3]/G1FB[6]",name))

Analysis %>% ggplot(aes(x=Vaccine,y=MeanValue))+
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA)+
  geom_point(position=position_jitter(0.1,seed=20210941),
             aes(col=CV>0.2))+
  facet_wrap(~name,nrow=4,ncol=4,scales="free_y")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size=6,angle=90))



```


There is a good amount of data (`r sum(Analysis$CV>0.2)` ) where the CV being greater than 0.2. Will be using all data, regardless of this.


```{r dividewk0, options}

NewAnalysis<-Analysis %>% 
  left_join(wk0_total_IgG %>% select(ID,name,wk0val=MeanValue)) %>% 
  mutate(MeanValue=MeanValue/wk0val)%>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  mutate(Vaccine=as.factor(Vaccine)) %>% 
  summarize(Pvalue=pvalue(wilcox_test(MeanValue ~ Vaccine,dist="exact"))[1]) %>% 
  mutate(FDR.adjust=p.adjust(Pvalue,"BH")) %>% 
  arrange(Pvalue)

NewAnalysis %>% select(name,AdjWk0Pvalue=Pvalue,FDR.adjust) %>% 
  DT::datatable(rownames=F) %>% 
  DT::formatSignif(c("FDR.adjust","AdjWk0Pvalue"))

```
